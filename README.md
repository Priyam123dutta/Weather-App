# Weather App

Hello everyone! I'm learning **Web Development**, andcurrently I am working with **APIs in JavaScript**. I built this **Weather App** to strengthen my understanding of how to fetch and display real-time data using external APIs.

This app allows you to check the current weather of any city. It’s a simple project focusing mainly on **JavaScript API handling**.

Feel free to check it out, try it with different cities, and share your feedback!

- The app will show the **temperature**, **weather condition**, **humidity**, and **wind speed**.
- If the city name is incorrect or not found, it will display an error message.

## Project Writeup

This project helped me learn and practice key JavaScript concepts like:

- Making API requests using `fetch()`
- Handling JSON data and extracting specific information
- Updating the DOM with real-time data
- Basic error handling (e.g., invalid input or network failure)
- Creating a clean and functional interface using HTML, CSS, and JS together
